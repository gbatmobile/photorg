# Photorg - a (not so) simple photo organizer

This program tries solving two common problems in photo and video organization - 
duplicated files spreading in many folders or devices. It uses hash signatures and 
EXIF  information to identify duplicated files, copy to a fresh folder organized by
date/time, events, etc, and, if wanted, remove them from the source.

It is unprobable photorg to delete not duplicated original files. You can even 
simulate operations that will be done, before it commit them. 

For helping, use --help option. Some examples of use can be get with --usage option.
