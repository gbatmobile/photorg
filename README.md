# Photorg - a (not so) simple photo organizer

This program tries solving two common problem in photo and video organization - 
duplicated files spreading at many folder. It use hash signatures and EXIF 
information to identify duplicated files, copy to a fresh folder organized by
date/time and, if wanted, remove them from the source.

It is unprobable to delete not duplicated original files. You can even simulate
operations will be done by photorg, before commit them. 

For helping use --help option and for examples of use try --usage option.
